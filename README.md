<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Night Crusade Titans is the final project created for the course in Client-side Development in the Fall semester of 2023. The theme of the course was learning front-end concepts, including frameworks, web services, and web architectures.

The application aims to streamline the process of reporting public disturbances, providing users with a user-friendly interface to submit and manage nuisance reports. By utilizing Angular for the front end and Firebase for database services, the app offers a comprehensive set of features for both users and administrators without making the architecture too complicated.

Night Crusade Titans stands out with its vibrant superhero theme. The aesthetic design of the website incorporates dark colors and an engaging user interface that captures the essence of superhero lore. This theme aims to make the reporting process more enjoyable and engaging for users, encouraging community involvement and making the task of reporting nuisances feel more like a collaborative effort in maintaining public safety.
